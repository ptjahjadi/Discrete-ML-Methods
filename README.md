# Classification Using Various Machine Learning Methods to Predict Tweet Locations
## Aim
The aim of this project is to assess various machine learning classification techniques for discrete data. The models are to predict tweets' locations across Australia using lexical analysis.
## Summary
Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Ensemble Learning Methods are analysed for its performance in predicting locations of tweets in Australia. Data and feature selection is performed and pre-processing is done to increase the classifiers' accuracy. Various academic literatures have confirmed the credibility of the machine learning algorithms implemented within this report and additional context would be required to increase the accuracy of prediction.
